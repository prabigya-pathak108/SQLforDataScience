    "# SQL Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "In SQL, aggregation functions are used to perform calculations on groups of rows to return a single result. These functions are often used with the GROUP BY clause to group rows based on certain criteria before applying the aggregation.It refers to the process of applying mathematical functions, such as SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, and MAX, to a set of values in a database table. These functions are used to perform calculations on groups of rows and return a single result. Aggregation is commonly used to summarize data, calculate totals, averages, counts, and identify minimum and maximum values within a dataset.\n",

    "## Common Aggregation Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **COUNT()**: Counts the number of rows in a group.\n",
    "2. **SUM()**: Calculates the sum of values in a group.\n",
    "3. **AVG()**: Calculates the average of values in a group.\n",

    "## Handling NULL Values in SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "In SQL, NULL is a special marker used to indicate that a data value does not exist or is unknown. NULL is not the same as zero or an empty string; it represents a missing or undefined value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics of NULL\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Absence of Value**: NULL represents the absence of a value in a column.\n",
    "- **Not Comparable**: NULL cannot be compared using equality operators (=, !=). Instead, special operators like IS NULL and IS NOT NULL are used to check for NULL values.\n",
    "- **Aggregation**: Aggregation functions like SUM() and AVG() exclude NULL values from calculations.\n",
    "- **Sorting**: NULL values are treated differently in sorting operations. They are typically considered greater than or less than non-NULL values, depending on the sorting order.\n",
    "- **Storage**: NULL values do not occupy any storage space in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling NULL Values\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Checking for NULL**: Use the IS NULL or IS NOT NULL operators to check whether a value is NULL.\n",
