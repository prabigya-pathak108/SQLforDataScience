    "\n",
    "## LIMIT Clause\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Retrieve a subset of rows from a dataset.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Useful for working with large datasets by limiting the number of rows returned.\n",
    "- **Example**: When exploring a dataset, data scientists might use the LIMIT clause to retrieve a small sample of rows for a quick overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "## DISTINCT Keyword\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Identify unique values within a dataset.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Helps in data cleaning and preprocessing by identifying unique categories, removing duplicates, and understanding data distribution.\n",
    "- **Example**: Data scientists might use the DISTINCT keyword to identify unique product categories in sales data or unique user IDs in engagement data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ORDER BY Clause\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Sort data based on specific criteria.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Essential for preparing data for visualization and analysis, and gaining insights.\n",
    "- **Example**: Data scientists might use the ORDER BY clause to sort time-series data in chronological order or sort survey responses based on response scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "These clauses and keywords provide data scientists with the flexibility to manipulate and analyze datasets effectively, enabling them to extract valuable insights and make informed decisions in their data science projects.\n",
